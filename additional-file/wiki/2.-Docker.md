### **1. What is Docker?**

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

### **2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of docker?**

#### The Advantages:

- Consistency
- Automation
- Stability
- Saves Space
- Run multiple applications with just one virtual machine

#### The Disadvantages:

- Advances Quickly
- Learning Curve

### **3. Install Docker:**

---

#### For windows:

**1. Go to the website https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/ and download the docker file.**

> **_Note: A 64-bit processor and 4GB system RAM are the hardware prerequisites required to successfully run Docker on Windows 10._**

**2. Then, double-click on the Docker Desktop Installer.exe to run the installer.**

> **_Note: Suppose the installer (Docker Desktop Installer.exe) is not downloaded; you can get it from Docker Hub and run it whenever required._**

**3. Once you start the installation process, always enable Hyper-V Windows Feature on the Configuration page.**

**4. Then, follow the installation process to allow the installer and wait till the process is done.**

**5. After completion of the installation process, click Close and restart.**

#### For linux (Ubuntu):

**1. Open the terminal on Ubuntu.**

**2. Remove any Docker files that are running in the system, using the following command:**

```
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
```

**3. Check if the system is up-to-date using the following command:**

```
sudo apt-get update
```

**4. Install a few pre-requisite packages that allow apt to use packages over HTTPS using the following command:**

```
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```

**5. Then add the GPG key for the Docker repository to your system:**

```
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
```

**6. Update the packages list again with Docker packages from the newly added repo:**

```
sudo apt update
```

**7. Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo:**

```
apt-cache policy docker-ce
```

Example Output:

```
docker-ce:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 18.03.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu
  Version table:
     18.03.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu 500
        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntubionic/stable amd64 Packages

```

**8. Install Docker:**

```
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

**9. Check if Docker is installed and running:**

```
sudo systemctl status docker
```

Example Output:

```
